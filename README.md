# Carmmunity Code Challenge 2018

In this code challenge, your goal is to create a basic Angular application that pulls the latest posts from https://www.reddit.com/r/gif/.json?count=20 and display them within the main page of the application. Replace the three example posts with a loop that displays the correct data from each of the top 20 posts. You should be able to click on any of the posts, and be brought to a (new) separate detail page that displays only that post.

- Display top 20 posts from /r/gif dynamically on the home page of the app
- Clicking a post should bring you to a new detail page (with url parameters) that shows only that single post
- Replace all example data with real data from the above json

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
